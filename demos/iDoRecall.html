      <p>Select some text with the mouse or by tapping. A context menu appears.</p>

      <p>Now try selecting the other way (e.g. right to left).</p>

      <p>Notice how the popover menu conveniently appears where you finished the selection.</p>

      <p>When clicking a menu item, the DevTools console will show the handler call result.</p>

      <p>Only selections at least 5 characters long trigger the menu. Try double-clicking to select this <i>word</i>.</p>

      <h1>More Features</h1>

      <p>Select across images and headings to test robustness.</p>

        Selecting text from a textarea should work too.
      </textarea>

      <p>Starting a selection in the textarea and ending it outside is handled properly.</p>

      <p>The menu disappears once you press the left mouse button down, before you release it, if the browser has cleared the selection.</p>

      <p>Select text. Mouse down on the selection, then after a second, mouse up. Both the selection and menu should disappear.</p>

      <p>Double click a word and right click on it. The menu should stay displayed. Don't move the mouse. Left click on the word again. Both the selection and the menu should disappear.</p>
      
      <p>An upcoming feature is to have the popover menu stay within the left and right bounds (red rectangle surrounding this text) as well.</p>

      <p>
        For now, it moves automatically when it touches the top or bottom of the window. Test this by select text from
        top to bottom and ending near the bottom of the window. The menu will be displayed at the top.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, scroll down, then select some text near the bottom of the window, but with enough space for the menu to
        appear beneath it.  Now, <strong>scroll up</strong>. Notice that when the menu touches the bottom, it
        automatically moves itself to the top of the selected text.

        "Are we rising again?" "No. On the contrary." "Are we descending?" "Worse
        than that, captain! we are falling!" "For Heaven's sake heave out the
        ballast!" "There! the last sack is empty!" "Does the balloon rise?" "No!"
        "I hear a noise like the dashing of waves. The sea is below the car! It
        cannot be more than 500 feet from us!" "Overboard with every weight! ...
        everything!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Such were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air,
        above the vast watery desert of the Pacific, about four o'clock in the
        evening of the 23rd of March, 1865.

      <p>
        Few can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the northeast, in
        the middle of the equinox of that year. The tempest raged without
        intermission from the 18th to the 26th of March. Its ravages were terrible
        in America, Europe, and Asia, covering a distance of eighteen hundred
        miles, and extending obliquely to the equator from the thirty-fifth north
        parallel to the fortieth south parallel. Towns were overthrown, forests
        uprooted, coasts devastated by the mountains of water which were
        precipitated on them, vessels cast on the shore, which the published
        accounts numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled by waterspouts
        which destroyed everything they passed over, several thousand people
        crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces of its fury, left
        by this devastating tempest. It surpassed in disasters those which so
        frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe, one on the 25th of October,
        1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825.
      </p>
      <p>
        But while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea, a
        drama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of a
        waterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column of air
        and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour, turning round
        and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing five
        passengers, scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor mingled with
        spray which hung over the surface of the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest? From what
        part of the world did it rise? It surely could not have started during the
        storm. But the storm had raged five days already, and the first symptoms
        were manifested on the 18th. It cannot be doubted that the balloon came
        from a great distance, for it could not have traveled less than two
        thousand miles in twenty-four hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their guidance,
        could not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed since
        their departure. It was a remarkable fact that, although in the very midst
        of the furious tempest, they did not suffer from it. They were thrown
        about and whirled round and round without feeling the rotation in the
        slightest degree, or being sensible that they were removed from a
        horizontal position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered
        beneath the car. Dark vapor was all around them. Such was the density of
        the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or night.
        No reflection of light, no sound from inhabited land, no roaring of the
        ocean could have reached them, through the obscurity, while suspended in
        those elevated zones. Their rapid descent alone had informed them of the
        dangers which they ran from the waves. However, the balloon, lightened of
        heavy articles, such as ammunition, arms, and provisions, had risen into
        the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a height of 4,500 feet. The
        voyagers, after having discovered that the sea extended beneath them, and
        thinking the dangers above less dreadful than those below, did not
        hesitate to throw overboard even their most useful articles, while they
        endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the life of their enterprise,
        which sustained them above the abyss.

        The night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to
        less energetic souls. Again the day appeared and with it the tempest began
        to moderate. From the beginning of that day, the 24th of March, it showed
        symptoms of abating. At dawn, some of the lighter clouds had risen into
        the more lofty regions of the air. In a few hours the wind had changed
        from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that is to say, the rate of the
        transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half. It was still
        what sailors call "a close-reefed topsail breeze," but the commotion in
        the elements had none the less considerably diminished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Towards eleven o'clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly clearer.
        The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt after the
        passage of a great meteor. The storm did not seem to have gone farther to
        the west. It appeared to have exhausted itself. Could it have passed away
        in electric sheets, as is sometimes the case with regard to the typhoons
        of the Indian Ocean?
